# JSON API Examples

This repository contains static JSON files for practicing API calls in JavaScript or Ruby. To access the raw JSON data from these files via code, click on a file here, and while viewing in GitHub, click the **Raw** button. This will redirect you and display the file directly, rather than through GitHub's user interface. Copy and paste the URL for this page - this URL can be used in HTTP requests to access the data.
